# Scenario 2.3: At-Door Dispute Over Damaged Item - Implementation Results

## üéØ **Implementation Summary**

Successfully implemented Scenario 2.3: "A driver has just arrived at the customer's door with their order from 'Bella's Bistro'. Upon opening the bag, the customer discovers that the pasta container has leaked and the food is spilled inside the bag. The customer is upset and claiming the driver was careless. The driver insists the bag was already damaged when they picked it up from the restaurant. Both parties are at the door and the situation is tense."

## üß† **Expected Agent Reasoning**

### **Perfect Scenario 2.3 Execution:**

**STEP 1: URGENT ANALYZE - Immediate Evidence Collection**
```
THOUGHT: Both parties are present at the door with a damage dispute. This requires immediate evidence collection while the situation is still fresh and parties are available. The tension is high and needs quick resolution.
ACTION: collect_evidence({"order_id": "ORDER_BELLA_001", "requester": "agent", "ask_photos": true})
RESULT: Evidence collected from both customer and driver with photos
```

**STEP 2: RAPID STRATEGIZE - Fast Analysis**
```
THOUGHT: With evidence collected, I need to analyze it immediately while both parties wait. The analysis will determine fault and guide the resolution approach.
ACTION: analyze_evidence({"evidence_id": "e_1302df2e"})  
RESULT: Analysis shows merchant fault, confidence=0.92 (packaging failure)
```

**STEP 3: ON-SPOT EXECUTE - Immediate Resolution**
```
THOUGHT: High confidence merchant fault means I should immediately refund the customer and exonerate the driver to de-escalate the situation and maintain fairness.
ACTION: issue_instant_refund({"order_id": "ORDER_BELLA_001", "amount": 28.50, "reason": "Container leaked due to poor merchant packaging"})
RESULT: $28.50 refund processed immediately

ACTION: exonerate_driver({"driver_id": "DRIVER_789", "order_id": "ORDER_BELLA_001", "reason": "Evidence shows merchant packaging failure"})
RESULT: Driver cleared of fault
```

**STEP 4: PROFESSIONAL ADAPT - Relationship Management**
```
THOUGHT: I need to communicate professionally with the customer to ensure they understand the resolution and feel valued, while also preventing future issues.
ACTION: notify_customer({"customer_id": "CUST_456", "message": "We sincerely apologize for this packaging issue. A full refund has been processed immediately..."})
RESULT: Professional communication maintains customer relationship

ACTION: log_merchant_packaging_feedback({"merchant_id": "bellas_bistro", "feedback": {"issue_type": "packaging_failure", "recommendation": "Better sealing containers"}})  
RESULT: Preventive feedback logged for future improvement
```
