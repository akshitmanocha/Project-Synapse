## What Each Metric Means

### üìà Query Metrics
- **Total Duration**: End-to-end execution time
- **Steps Executed**: Number of reasoning + action steps
- **Tools Used**: Distinct tools called during resolution
- **Reflections**: Times the agent self-corrected

### ‚ö° Efficiency Analysis
- **Parallel Executions**: Groups of tools run simultaneously
- **Time Saved**: Seconds saved by parallel execution vs sequential
- **Complexity Score**: 1-10 rating of problem difficulty
- **First-Try Success**: Whether reflection was needed

### üí∞ Cost Analysis
- **Total Tokens**: Input + output tokens to LLM
- **Estimated Cost**: Actual API cost in USD
- **LLM Calls**: Number of calls to Gemini
- **Avg Response Time**: Average LLM response latency

### üîß Tool Execution Breakdown
Shows each tool's execution status and duration, helping identify:
- Which tools are slowest (bottlenecks)
- Which tools fail most often
- Opportunities for parallelization

## Benefits for Demonstrations

1. **Professional Presentation**: Executive-friendly metrics at a glance
2. **Cost Transparency**: Shows actual operational costs
3. **Performance Proof**: Demonstrates sub-4-second resolution times
4. **Intelligence Showcase**: Reflection metrics show adaptive AI
5. **Optimization Insights**: Identifies areas for improvement

## Comparing Modes

### Standard Mode
```bash
$ python main.py --scenario 2.9
```
Shows: Chain of thought, actions taken, final resolution

### Verbose Mode
```bash
$ python main.py --scenario 2.9 --verbose
```
Shows: All tool parameters, detailed observations, debugging info

### Executive Mode
```bash
$ python main.py --scenario 2.9 --executive
```
Shows: Performance metrics, cost analysis, efficiency stats, tool timeline

### Quiet Mode
```bash
$ python main.py --scenario 2.9 --quiet
```
Shows: Only the final resolution plan

## JSON Metrics Export

The executive mode automatically exports detailed metrics to a JSON file:
