# Safety emergency requiring human intervention
python main.py --scenario human.1 --verbose
```

### Direct Tool Usage
```python
from synapse.tools.tools import issue_monetary_voucher

# This will trigger approval workflow
result = issue_monetary_voucher(
    customer_id="cust_123",
    amount=75.0,  # Requires manager approval
    reason="Delivery failure with food spoilage"
)

print(f"Voucher issued: {result['voucher_issued']}")
print(f"Approval status: {result['approval_status']}")
print(f"Authorization level: {result['authorization_level']}")
```

## üîÑ Approval Workflow

```
1. Agent detects need for financial/high-impact action
   ‚Üì
2. Authorization system checks thresholds and keywords
   ‚Üì
3. If approval required:
   - Create approval request
   - Route to appropriate authorization level
   - Simulate approval decision (demo mode)
   ‚Üì
4. If approved: Execute action with conditions
   If denied: Return rejection reason
   If emergency: Override available for critical situations
```
