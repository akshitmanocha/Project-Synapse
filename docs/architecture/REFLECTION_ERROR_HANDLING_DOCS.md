# 🔄 Synapse Agent: Reflection and Error Handling System

## 📋 **Implementation Overview**

The Synapse agent now includes a sophisticated **Reflection Node** in its LangGraph workflow that automatically detects tool execution failures and provides intelligent guidance for alternative approaches. This system transforms the agent from a linear executor to an adaptive problem-solver.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Enhancement**

### **Enhanced Workflow: reason → act → reflect → reason**

The original workflow has been enhanced from:
```
reason → act → reason → act → ...
```

To an adaptive system:
```  
reason → act → reflect → reason → act → reflect → ...
```

### **New Components Added:**

1. **Reflection Node**: Analyzes tool execution results and detects failures
2. **Adaptive Reasoning**: Enhanced reasoning node that processes reflection guidance  
3. **Error Pattern Recognition**: Comprehensive failure detection across all tool categories
4. **Loop Prevention**: Built-in safeguards against infinite reflection cycles

## 🧠 **Reflection Node Logic**

### **Core Functionality:**
```python
def reflection_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    # 1. Analyze last tool execution
    # 2. Detect failure patterns
    # 3. Suggest alternative approaches
    # 4. Prevent infinite loops
    # 5. Update state with adaptation guidance
```

### **Failure Detection Patterns:**

| Tool Category | Failure Condition | Alternative Suggestion |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Recipient Contact** | `contact_successful = False` | `suggest_safe_drop_off` |
| **Safe Drop-off** | `safe_option_available = False` | `find_nearby_locker` |
| **Locker Search** | `lockers_found = False` | `schedule_redelivery` |
| **Redelivery** | `scheduled = False` | `contact_sender` |
| **Evidence Collection** | `evidence_collected = False` | `issue_instant_refund` |
| **Evidence Analysis** | `confidence < 0.5` | `issue_partial_refund` |
| **Traffic Check** | `incident_level = "severe"` | `re_route_driver` |
| **Merchant Status** | `status = "closed"` | `get_nearby_merchants` |
| **Instant Refund** | `requires_approval = True` | `issue_partial_refund` |

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Enhanced AgentState**
```python
class AgentState(TypedDict, total=False):
    # Original fields
    input: str
    steps: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    plan: Optional[str]
    action: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    observation: Optional[Any]
    done: bool
    
    # New reflection fields
    needs_adaptation: bool
    reflection_reason: Optional[str]
    suggested_alternative: Optional[str]
```

### **2. Reflection Node Implementation**
```python
def reflection_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    # Prevent infinite loops
    total_steps = len(steps)
    reflection_count = sum(1 for step in steps if step.get("action", {}).get("tool_name") == "reflect")
    
    if total_steps >= 20:
        state["done"] = True
        return state
    elif reflection_count >= 5:
        state["done"] = True  
        return state
        
    # Analyze last tool execution
    last_step = steps[-1]
    observation = last_step.get("observation", {})
    tool_name = action.get("tool_name", "")
    
    # Pattern matching for failures
    if needs_reflection:
        # Add reflection step
        reflection_step = {
            "thought": f"REFLECTION: {reflection_reason}. Need to adapt approach.",
            "action": {"tool_name": "reflect", "parameters": {...}},
            "observation": {"status": "reflection", ...}
        }
        steps.append(reflection_step)
        
        # Set adaptation flags
        state["needs_adaptation"] = True
        state["reflection_reason"] = reflection_reason
        state["suggested_alternative"] = alternative_approach
```

### **3. Enhanced Reasoning Node**
The reasoning node now processes reflection guidance:
```python
# Include reflection information if available
reflection_context = ""
if state.get("needs_adaptation"):
    reflection_reason = state.get("reflection_reason", "")
    suggested_alternative = state.get("suggested_alternative", "")
    reflection_context = f"\n\n⚠️ REFLECTION GUIDANCE:\n" \
                        f"Previous approach encountered an issue: {reflection_reason}\n"
    if suggested_alternative:
        reflection_context += f"Consider using tool: {suggested_alternative}\n"
    reflection_context += "Please adapt your approach accordingly.\n"

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content=sys_prompt),
    HumanMessage(content=(
        "Problem: " + user_problem + "\n\n" +
        "Context (previous steps):\n" + history + 
        reflection_context + "\n\n" +
        "Decide the next best single tool call."
    )),
]
```

## 🎯 **Error Handling Patterns**

### **1. Escalation Failures (Recipient Unavailable)**
```
contact_recipient_via_chat FAILS
    ↓ REFLECTION: "Recipient contact failed - need alternative delivery approach"
    ↓ SUGGESTION: suggest_safe_drop_off
    
suggest_safe_drop_off FAILS  
    ↓ REFLECTION: "Safe drop-off not available - try locker option"
    ↓ SUGGESTION: find_nearby_locker
    
find_nearby_locker FAILS
    ↓ REFLECTION: "No lockers available - escalate to redelivery"
    ↓ SUGGESTION: schedule_redelivery
    
schedule_redelivery FAILS
    ↓ REFLECTION: "Redelivery scheduling failed - contact sender"
    ↓ SUGGESTION: contact_sender
```

### **2. Evidence Collection Chain Failures**
```
collect_evidence FAILS
    ↓ REFLECTION: "Evidence collection failed - proceed with customer satisfaction approach"
    ↓ SUGGESTION: issue_instant_refund
    
analyze_evidence (low confidence)
    ↓ REFLECTION: "Evidence analysis has low confidence - proceed with goodwill approach"  
    ↓ SUGGESTION: issue_partial_refund
```

### **3. Communication and Routing Failures**
```
notify_customer FAILS
    ↓ REFLECTION: "Customer notification failed - try alternative communication"
    
check_traffic (severe incident)
    ↓ REFLECTION: "Severe traffic detected - need alternative routing"
    ↓ SUGGESTION: re_route_driver
    
contact_merchant FAILS  
    ↓ REFLECTION: "Merchant unavailable - try direct stock check"
    ↓ SUGGESTION: get_merchant_status
```
