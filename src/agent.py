"""
AGENT MODULE SPEC (LangGraph skeleton)

Purpose:
- Provide a minimal, testable framework for a LangGraph-based agent that
	iteratively reasons, selects a tool to act, observes the outcome, and repeats
	until the problem is solved (Reason-Act-Observe loop).

At this stage (milestone 1.3):
- The code defines data structures, placeholders, and the graph wiring only.
- All functional elements contain 'pass' and no real logic is executed.
- This scaffolding enables incremental development and testing later.

Core components in this file:
- AgentState (TypedDict): The shared state passed between nodes.
	keys:
		- input: str — the user problem description.
		- steps: list — intermediate actions/observations (append-only log).
		- plan: str | None — final structured plan once the agent decides to finish.
		- action: dict | None — the next action chosen by the Reasoning node
			(e.g., {"tool": "check_traffic", "args": {"route": "..."}}).
		- observation: any — the last tool result.
		- done: bool — set True to stop the loop.

- Nodes:
	1) reasoning_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState
		 - Chooses next action or sets done and plan.
	2) tool_exec_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState
		 - Executes the chosen tool and records observation.

- Graph wiring:
	- The graph alternates between reasoning_node and tool_exec_node
		until state['done'] is True.

Usage (future):
- build_graph() returns a graph object compatible with LangGraph execution.
- run_agent(input_text: str) is a convenience wrapper to execute the graph.

Note:
- Replace 'pass' blocks in a later milestone with actual logic, prompts, and tool calls.
